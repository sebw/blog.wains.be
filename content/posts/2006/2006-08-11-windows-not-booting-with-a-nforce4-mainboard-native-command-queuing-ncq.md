I had a computer for repair lately.
After several attempt to install Windows XP, it was always randomly hanging (1 out of 5 times, it would boot) while booting the system.

I had to disable Native Command Queuing (NCQ) to avoid the problem, the maxtor hard drive or the mainboard chipset wasn't fully compatible with NCQ.
