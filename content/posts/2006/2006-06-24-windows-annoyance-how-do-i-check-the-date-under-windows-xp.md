title: "Windows annoyance - how do I check the date under Windows XP ?"
---

For security reasons, I run my session as a limited user (Group "Users" under security settings).
What if I want to check today's date ?
Double-click over the time in the lower right corner of the screen ? A window pops up saying I don't have the rights needed to EDIT the system hour.. Hell, I just want to check today's date buddy, not modify it !

If you are fortunate enough and leave your pointer over the hour for a few seconds, a tooltip window will appear (occurs about 1 out of 20 times for me)... and if your are really fortunate, this tooltip would appear above the traybar, not under (never happened for me) !

Gosh I love Windows XP... you need administrative privileges to check the date out.
