This is my new laptop

I can't swear it is fully Linux compatible, I haven't tested the modem yet.
EDIT 24 jan 07 : Sound issue was fixed by installing the latest alsa drivers manually (I currently am under Ubunbu 6.10)

Specifications :
Intel Core Duo T2300 @ 1.66 Ghz
512 MB DDR2 533 Mhz
60 Gb HDD Fujitsu 5400 RPM SATA
DVD+-RW
15" XGA 1024x768
56K Modem / LAN
Wireless Intel IPW3945 abg (WPA2 working under Ubuntu 6.06)
Ms Windows XP Home Edition (blah)

Currently running Fedora Core 5
**EDIT :** now running Ubuntu 6.06

For those wondering, bought at Makro for €799 on 10 aug 2006
It's quite a deal, you just don't get the new brightview screens and card readers, but I didn't think it was worth the extra €200+
