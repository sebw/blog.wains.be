If you want to batch rename files under Linux, check out PrefixSuffix.

I'm usually all for the CLI, but this nifty tool is quite convenient (if you have a GUI available :-) )

It is available right in the Ubuntu repositories, but not under Debian's.

(for the CLI addicts, feel free to post oneliners doing the same job (and even more))
