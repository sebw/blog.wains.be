title: "Workflow automation under Mac with Hammerspoon"
---
I'm spending a lot of time at work automating processes (with Rundeck, Salt, Jenkins, Nexus, SVN, etc.).

At the personal level, I have automated most of my recurring tasks (disabling Wi-Fi automatically, silence mode at work, etc.) on Android using Automagic: [http://automagic4android.com/en/](http://automagic4android.com/en/)

I discovered a couple of days ago Hammerspoon for Mac: [http://www.hammerspoon.org/](http://www.hammerspoon.org/)

Quoting their website:

_This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user._

My personal configuration is available [here](https://github.com/sebw/hammerspoon).
