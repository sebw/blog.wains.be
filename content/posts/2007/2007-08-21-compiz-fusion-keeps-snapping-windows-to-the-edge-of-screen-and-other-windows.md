title: "Compiz Fusion keeps snapping windows to the edge of screen and other windows"

Even though the "snapping windows" plugin is disabled, the windows keep sticking to the edge of anything around. This is a major annoyance, leading me to struggle with the windows to go where I want them to go. This is really counter-productive.

**Fix :**

In CompizConfig Configuration Manager, navigate to Wobbly Windows and disable Snap Inverted.
