See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup)

nohup is a Unix command that is used to run another command while suppressing the action of the HUP (hangup) signal, enabling the command to keep running after the user who issues the command has logged out. It is most often used to run commands in background as daemons. Output that would normally go to the terminal goes to a file called nohup.out if it has not already been redirected.

Example :

`$ nohup gedit &
nohup: appending output to `nohup.out'`

I can now close the terminal from which I launched gedit, gedit will keep running. Without nohup, gedit would close along with the terminal.

`$ cat nohup.out`
This would display what was supposed to be output to the terminal..

Anyway, this post is just for the record, because I'm using [screen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) which is a better alternative
