My friend Jonathan just passed me another nice CLI tip

Sometimes, some commands output are not really readable :

Example : 
`$ mount`

Readability can be improved by piping "mount" into the command "column"

`$ mount | column -t`


There are so many little useful commands like these under Linux, I wish I knew them all.
Any other similar tips are welcomed !
