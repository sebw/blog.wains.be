**Problem** : 

Since the new version of Gmail, I was having issues when downloading attachments. The Gmail tab would go blank. The only way to get back to Gmail was to close the tab and open Gmail again. Reloading was not helping.


**Solution** :

My problem was because of the add-on "Tab Mix Plus"

- Open Tab Mix Plus options
- Links tab
- Click on "edit" in regard to "Prevent blank tabs when downloading files"
- Remove from the list the lines /disp=attd&view=att/ and /view=att&disp=attd/
